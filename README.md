# Welcome to Zak Tedder's Debt Calculator

This program takes in multiple inputs of debt with different principle balances, interest rates, and minimum payments. The program then displays the accumulative information and asks for a monthly payment, which must be greater than the sum of all minimum payments. The amount of time to pay off the total debt is displayed after being calculated by targeting the debt with the highest interest rate and lowest principal balance first, and then moving to the next lowest interest rate or higher principal balance accordingly. 

The source code is in the DebtRepaymentCalculator folder and the executable application is in the DebtRepaymentCalculator/bin/Debug folder. Enjoy!
