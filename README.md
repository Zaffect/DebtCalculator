# Welcome to Zak Tedder's Debt Calculator

This program takes in multiple inputs of debt with different principle balances, interest rates, and minimum payments. The program then displays the accumulative information and asks for a monthly payment, which must be greater than or equal to the sum of all minimum payments. The amount of time to pay off the total debt is displayed after being calculated by targeting the debt with the highest interest rate and lowest principal balance first, and then moving to the next lowest interest rate or higher principal balance accordingly. 

The executable application is DebtRepaymentCalculator.exe in the main folder and the source code is in the DebtRepaymentCalculator folder. Enjoy!
